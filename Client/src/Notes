TCP provides a connection-oriented communication between client-server applications.
To communicated over TCP, client and server programs establish a connection using sockets
and then they send and receive packets though them. A socket is a end-point of a two-way
communication link. A socket is bound to a port number so the TCP layer can identify the
application it is connected to. An end-point is a combination of IP address and port number.
